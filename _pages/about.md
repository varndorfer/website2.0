Hello! My name is Vanessa Arndorfer and I am a software engineer with a strong background in interdisciplinary research. I spent five years at Microsoft, building the backend services that power Azure AI. While completing my master’s degree, I rediscovered a passion for data-driven research and am pursuing new opportunities to continue my work exploring the applications of machine learning in other STEM domains.

Research Interests
======
Interdisciplinary applied machine learning within other STEM fields. Applications of interest include:
- Environmental solutions
- Smart homes and smart cities
- Resource management
- Climate modeling

Experience
======
I received my MS in Computer Science from the University of Washington in 2025. My thesis in **computational neuroscience** analyzed and visualized data from a neural growth simulation. Previously, I was a Software Engineer II at Microsoft where I built APIs and drove feature development for Azure AI. I also interned for the Feature Engineering team at Microsoft where I compared **feature selection algorithms** on benchmark datasets for implementation on AzureML. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research at the Virginia Tech Hume Center for National Security and Technology. I was on multiple projects examining applications of **Radio Frequency Machine Learning** including using **feature augmentation** to create robust radio signal datasets, developing **convolutional neural network** architecture for classifying radio signals, and developing a loss function to provide feedback to an adversarial machine learning network.
